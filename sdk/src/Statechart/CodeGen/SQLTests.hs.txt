in here there will be logic for gathering the information
from the analysis and use it to generate the
notify_state_machine sequences together we the redefinition
of the function fsm.handle_state_events (or something like
that) that I checked and it worked.




-- given a path, we can generate a sql test for it
genTest :: Path -> Text
genTest = undefined



layoutNotifyStateMachine = [iii| select fsm.notify_state_machine...etc |]

layoutReplaceEventHandler = [iii| create or replace function fsm.handle_machine_events...etc |]

-- TODO consider how similar the generation of SQL tests is
to what we already have in terms of SQL generation, because
we generate the sql charts. So should they be a single
helper module and this kind of thing to make things smaller
and more robust?
